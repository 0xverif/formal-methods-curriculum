# SAT

## Introduction

SAT, short for *satisfiability*, is the name given to the problem of determining whether a certain Boolean formula can be satisfied.
By satisfiable it is meant whether by replacing the variables that make up the Boolean formula by TRUE or FALSE the formula evaluates to TRUE. In case such a combination is possible the formula is called *satisfiable*.

Most students will remember this problem from high-school or undergrad courses, but maybe they've learned it with a different name in the past.

An example of a satisfiable formula is "A \/ B" (where \/ means or), which can be satisfied for example by assigning values A = TRUE, B = TRUE.

An example of a non-satisfiable formula is "A /\ -A", where no combination of assignement of values to the formula variables will lead to a case where the formula is TRUE.
